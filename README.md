# grade_system
This project is part of my Homework for programming course, and it's also my first repository on GitHub.
This simple grade system enable students, teachers and administrators to manage the grade information. Besides, it includes some basie rank and other statistical functions.
Chances are that many bugs exists. I'll be grateful for bug report.
